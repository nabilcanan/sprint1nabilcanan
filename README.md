Everything works.
This project uses a get request to pull data from a wufoo form and prints it to the terminal and writes it to a text file as well. 
Nothing missing in this project. 

## Sprint 2
This project gets the form entry data required. 
Then creates the database correctly. 
The tests in this programs were working then I could not fix them before the submission date. 
The fields I used are from my form that are in the link provided.
